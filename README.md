# game-of-life
A GUI implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automota.

Currently runs under GOLMain with a passed text file containing the world setup.
I am working on a GUI implementation to replace this because GOLMain is poorly 
implemented(coupled) and because I am trying to apply my knowledge of the MVC design scheme to Java's Swing library

MVC design inspiration from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/index-142890.html#8
