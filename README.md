## Summary
Conway's Game of Life is a simulation in which an initially configured world of cells(with two states: dead or alive) is evolved based on a specified rule set. This rule set determines the new state of each cell in each generation depending on how many adjacent cells each cell has.
These generations are not random and as a result often result in interesting patterns.

This specific implementation of Conway's Game of Life allows for extensive world customization, saving, loading, and manipulation. All of this is wrapped into a simple GUI.
Note that this implementation was approached with the objective of learning the [MVC design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).
